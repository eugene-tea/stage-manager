# Changelog

## 1.3.0 — 2026-10-21

- Your stages come back after a restart. When you log out, restart or shut down, Stage
  Manager brings every window back first, so macOS saves them where they really are; after
  you log back in, the windows macOS reopens go back into their saved stages, on each Desktop.
  Windows that some apps (VS Code, Slack and other Electron apps) reopen on the wrong Desktop
  join their saved stage where they appear. Turn it off with `[stages] restore_after_restart`.
- ⌘-Tab and Dock clicks grow the app's windows from their card, as Apple's do; the corner
  stays clean while they do.
- A card shows a window without a gray box around it when a popup is open.
- Quitting is quieter and cleaner: hidden tabs and other apps' helper windows no longer count
  as windows left in the corner, and a leftover safety helper hands its windows to the next
  copy of Stage Manager instead of waiting for days.
- A window closed while its app is not responding leaves its stage (no empty gray card).
- Window pictures retry less often after failures and pause while the Mac is locked or
  asleep, which saves battery.
- The menu bar icon is the same height as Apple's own symbols.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-13

- Automatic updates: Stage Manager downloads a new version from GitHub, checks that it is
  signed by its developer and notarized by Apple, brings your windows back, replaces itself
  and relaunches. It asks first; Settings can make it install on its own.
- Only one copy manages your windows; launching it again opens the running copy's Settings.
- Safer quits and crashes: a crash can no longer leave the app hanging with windows in the
  corner, a busy app no longer slows switching, and the saved stages are never lost to a
  failed save.
- Privacy: the log no longer records window titles (only a short code), and Stage Manager's
  files are readable by you only.
- The clean corner stays inert after you type a password.
- Apple silicon Macs only (said on the page and in Homebrew).

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-13

- Desktops keep their stages across restarts, and when you move windows between Desktops.
  A window moved to another Desktop goes where a new window of its app would open there.
- ⌘-Tab, Dock and click switches animate again: the stage you leave shrinks into the strip
  behind the app you switch to.
- Quitting brings back every window from the corner, even from an app that is busy at that
  moment; a window that cannot be reached yet is brought back as soon as it can be.
- The strip stays in front, and stays put under the pointer, while you click through its
  cards with windows covering it.
- The clean corner hides during Show Desktop and comes back with Mission Control.
- New documentation: a short user guide, a configuration reference and development notes.

## 1.0.0

- **2026-10-12** — Day one of daily use. The strip matches Apple's down to the card tilt,
  and each Desktop gets its own stages and strip. Switches animate. Cards can be reordered,
  and dropping one card on another merges the two stages. The strip hides during Mission
  Control. Safety layers mean a window is never left hidden, not even after a crash. Logs
  are kept per day, with a "Mark a Problem" menu item.
- **2026-10-13** — Version 1.0.0, signed and notarized. A menu bar app with Settings, About,
  update checks and launch at login; it stands down while Apple's Stage Manager is on. A
  Dock click to an app on another Desktop arranges that Desktop before it slides in. The
  parked windows' corner is clean: their slivers ignore clicks, and a patch drawn from the
  wallpaper's own file covers them, with no screen recording.
