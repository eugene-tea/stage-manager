# Stage Manager: plan

What's still to do. What shipped is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), how the app is built is in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), how it should behave is in [docs/UX-SPEC.md](docs/UX-SPEC.md),
and what users asked for is in [docs/FEATURE-REQUESTS.md](docs/FEATURE-REQUESTS.md).

## 1.8.x: everything known broken or unchecked

Version 1 is Apple's Stage Manager, copied with nothing left: fixes and checks only; new features
wait for 2.0. Nothing is open (1.8.3, 11-09). Known gaps that can't be closed from our side are in
UX-SPEC, "Known gaps".

**When it happens, no session needed:**

- **Eugene's next real restart.** In that day's log, check:
  - the launch's `recovery scan` line shows `restored=0` (no window came back hidden)
  - no `app activated … queued_ms` over 100 in the first two minutes, and if there is one, the
    `slow WM task` line names what held the thread
  - the `restore:` summary line
- **"macOS isn't reporting windows" shows in the menu again.** Quit Stage Manager, then count windows with
  System Events (`osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to count windows of every process'`). If
  any are listed, our quit fixed it: the menu line then says "Quit and reopen Stage Manager", and the bug
  is ours. If none are listed, lock and unlock the screen and count again.

## 2.0: new features

- **A right-click menu on cards** (R4): Bring Here, New Stage, Keep on Every Stage, Name Stage…, Close
  Window, Quit App. A named stage shows its name on hover (R7).
- **Stages in the menu bar menu**, click one to switch (R2).
- **Drop a window on a card** to add it to that stage (R3b). Apple's has none: its strip hides
  instead (11-09).
- **"Only the main screen" in Settings** (`[displays] main_only`, off; R8). The setting is read at launch, so
  turning it on or off quits the app (every window comes back) and opens it again, as an update does. Its
  line in Settings says so.
- **Scroll the strip past its capacity**, with a "+N" mark (R5).
- **No stage switches the user didn't ask for** (R6): an activation with no click or key press just before
  it doesn't switch stages, and that app's card glows.
- **One stage across all screens** (R8, second half), an option, off. One strip, on the main screen. A
  switch brings a stage's windows back on every screen. Still open: what it means when "Displays have
  separate Spaces" is on, and the lid and restart rules once a window moved to another screen keeps its
  stage.
